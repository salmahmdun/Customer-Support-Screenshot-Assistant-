# 1. 📌 Project Overview & Introduction

## 👀 Project Overview

Customer support teams spend a significant amount of time reviewing screenshots, understanding customer issues, categorizing tickets, and drafting responses.

This project demonstrates how modern Vision-Language Models can automate parts of this workflow using Gemma 4 Vision.

Instead of manually reviewing screenshots, the assistant can:

- Understand screenshot content
- Extract relevant information
- Identify customer issues
- Classify support requests
- Suggest professional responses

The project covers a complete multimodal AI pipeline:

- Dataset preparation
- Screenshot preprocessing
- Vision-language fine-tuning
- Local inference
- Gradio interface
- Evaluation pipeline
